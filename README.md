# Text Document Enhancer

Welcome to the Text Document Enhancer's GitHub Repository! Right now, I have the Python code, a project documentation report, and a presentation so that viewers may understand the project's purpose, functionality, and performance. Very soon, I should be able to offer the ability to download the application like any other executable file as this project only requires two additional libraries on top of the ones used for Python, OpenCV and PyTesseract. If you have any questions or concerns about the project, you may communicate with me through this GitHub account. Also, this project is open-source, so you may add or modify any of the project code to improve its quality and/or add more core image processing features by sending pull requests. If you choose to update this project in your repository, please be aware of the license requirements before doing so. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the application!
